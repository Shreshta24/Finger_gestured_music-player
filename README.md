# ♫ Finger Tunes ♫


## Basic Details

### Project Description
A Carnatic music player that uses hand gestures to play different swaras. No mouse, no keyboard — just flex your fingers and let the ragas flow.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Do you ever feel like your fingers are too idle while listening to music?
Ever wanted to compose a raga while flexing like a gym bro?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a system where your hand muscles control music.
Raise a finger, hear a swara. Raise all five? It's practically a concert.
No actual musical knowledge required — just working joints.

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

*This screenshot shows the main landing page of the Finger Tunes website. It features a clean UI with a central “Start Webcam Detection” button to activate hand gesture recognition. Below that is a Hand Gesture Guide explaining which hand signs correspond to specific swaras (Sa, Ri, Ga, etc.). The page is styled with a dark gradient background and emoji-based visual cues to keep it fun and accessible.*

Swara Detection in Action (Real-Time Webcam Feed)
<img width="1087" height="775" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 062448" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1542a9f4-745e-42d3-9dbb-7e1eb299f69e" />
*This image shows the real-time webcam interface of the Finger Tunes project in action. The window titled “Carnatic Swara Player” displays the live video feed with MediaPipe hand tracking overlaid using red landmarks and connecting lines.
The user is showing a closed fist gesture, which is correctly recognized as the swara "Sa", as indicated by the green text “Swara: Sa” at the top-left corner. This confirms the gesture-to-note mapping works as intended in the live detection environment.*

Gesture-to-Note Mapping (Swara: Ga)
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (448)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c3bb96f-7e38-42d3-a268-15f62f610d5a" />
*This snapshot shows another working example of the Finger Tunes project. The user is performing a different hand gesture (extended fingers) which is correctly recognized as "Swara: Ga", shown in large green text.*
